I submit the following for assessment as my best class.

* The Node class
* The Viewer class
* The updateAndCheck method is TwistGame class, and all methods related to it.
* The piece class. The way I designed how to represent each piece as two strings of integers for its position and hole/filled state.  

I declare that this is entirely my own work, with the following documented exceptions:

* the idea of the Viewer class, Node representation of the game came from studying the code from assignment from scratch.

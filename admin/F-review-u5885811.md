Review Comments:

1. What are the best features of this code?
The best feature is the use of recursive computation, which effectively saves up the computation time and resources compared 
to going through every possible combination of piece orientations and locations.


2. Is the code well-documented?
The documentation and comments are good but can be improved by specifying the input format and functionality of a few methods
invloved like "Allsolution", "GetNewSolution".


3. Is the program decomposition (class and method structure) appropriate?
The program involves 4 seperate methods (included all in TwistGame class) and only interacts with the placement string. Since it's 
relatively simple, the methods are set up in a good structure that no extra global variable or computation is needed.


4. Does it follow Java code conventions, and is the style consistent throughout?
The style is consistent with previous codes, with the possible improvements in : 1. comment and documentation style.  2. variable names starts with lower letter.


5. Suggest a particular situation in which the program will not function correctly.
Not any from existing situation.
